All the code is written in C++.

fork: The following code calculates the area under a mathematical function's curve using fork.

semaphore: The following code calculates the area under a mathematical function's curve using semaphores and process synchronization.

FiveStateProcessModel: This program implements a five-state model of concurrent processes, where four processes run simultaneously, each printing a specific character. Coordination between these processes is achieved using semaphores.

RR3 (Round Robin with Time Quantum of 3): RR3 is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice of 3 units. If a process does not complete within its time slice, it is moved to the back of the queue, allowing other processes to execute.

SPN (Shortest Process Next): SPN is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the shortest execution time to run next. This minimizes the average waiting time for processes but can lead to starvation for longer processes.
